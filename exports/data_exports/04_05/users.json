	"two_step_verified": true,
	"question_1": "Within the serene expanse of the campus, whether its cycling early in the morning or taking a stroll with friends in the night, there's always company - chirping of birds or the dogs. Conversations ranging from mundane to the profound life talks. From devouring Bhandara delights at the mandir premises to diving into events at Nalanda (and of course giving our own running commentary) or barging into the fun games, the thrill is real when the friends/ seniors(who are more like friends than seniors when it comes to fun) are in a mix. The seniors aren't just mentors, they're more like pals offering the best of both worlds - wisdom with a pinch of playfulness. \nI'll reminisce these cherished moments. These are like stubborn glitter from a party - bright, mess, annoying, and impossible to shake off.",
	"question_2": "1. Sustainability Initiatives - Introducing recycling programs, reducing usage of plastic waste, and promoting eco-friendly practices to minimize campus's environmental footprint\n\n2. Community Gardens - Establishing community gardens on campus where students, faculty and staff can come together to cultivate plants, explore diverse farming techniques and most importantly relish the experience together in open air.\nWhile we do have the plantation drives - typically confined to a few weekends at the start of the monsoon. Having a year long initiative would be far more rewarding. It would provide a refreshing escape after or before a busy day on campus. \n\n3. Pets on campus: I acknowledge the gradual  utilization of the designated area for caretaking. But its imperative  to prevent them from entering the hostels and lab premises (POD buildings). Our furry friends may roam freely around the campus and frankly feels good as well (as long as they don't bite anyone), The moment they enter, they tend to scatter garbage from  trash cans, making the corridors dirty. and leaving trails of trash. Some measures to control this would be appreciated. \n\n4. Timely start of events: Many events on campus tend to start late. Most of us come from labs and have submissions/ deadlines hovering all the time and all of us usually get back to the as soon as the event concludes. So timely start would be greatly appreciated.\n\n5. Addition of events: While most events are organized well and happen frequently, I would like to suggest scheduling classical/melody evenings, like the recent rendition to Rafi Saab, more regularly, perhaps every 3-4 months. These events offer unique dimension that appeals to a significant portion of the crowd, as many of us have a special corner for the classics and old songs apart from the rock/pop songs we listen and enjoy/ vibe on daily basis.\n\nLast and something silly up next!\n6. Introduction of Chat Bhandar: Please get one chat bhandar into the campus. The 99% crowd loves it, and it's such a big business that runs throughout the year, even in summers. Because when it comes to satisfying cravings, a chat bhandar is the ultimate flavor saver apart from ice-creams. ",

Embracing sustainability initiatives, investing in technology infrastructure, and fostering partnerships with local businesses would prepare students for success in the workforce while instilling values that contribute positively to society.

Sensible talks that shifts to non sense after some time and also the people here who helped me a lot including my seniors and juniors. Also the two years that I have spent here which seem to be very much when I joined but now it feels like how quickly time has went with friends who became like a family in these years. Last but not the least I will also miss my tenure as GS Academics here which taught me a lot about the things apart from academics and my academic council members who supported me throughout my tenure.",
	"question_2": "If I would be given the power to implement a change here then I will give full powers to students for organizing events, seminars etc. and involvement of others would be there as advisors only because here I have seen that students have a lot to show here but due to so much restrictions and work load they just give up and along with this one more thing I would like to change and add some rules in Training and Placement as well as in internship programs which do not allow all of the students to participate fully for their carrer building due to which students suffer during placements unlike some other institutes which gives their students some rights to take decisions by themselves with the involvement of others as advisors only..",

	"question_1": "After graduating, I know I'll miss so many things about college life. It's been such an incredible journey with a lot of ups and downs . The people I've met, the experiences I've had, and the lessons I've learned have shaped me in ways I couldn't have imagined. There's something special about being surrounded by like-minded individuals who share your passions and interests. The vibe on campus is just unmatched ‚Äì every day is filled with opportunities for growth and improvement.\n\nOne of the things I'll miss the most is the sense of companionship that comes with working together towards a common goal, whether it's a team project or event. These collaborative efforts have taught me so much and have been some of the most rewarding experiences.\n\nWhen I first arrived at IIT Indore, I was a different person, but over the years, I've learned to take full advantage of everything our college has to offer beyond academics. From exploring the beautiful campus life , building cool projects , to just enjoying early morning walks and witnessing the rays of sunshine, there's a sense of peace and rejuvenation that I'll miss that most .\n\nAnd let's not forget about the amazing facilities ‚Äì from state-of-the-art labs to cozy libraries and everything in between, our campus truly has it all. But what truly makes it special are the passionate and hardworking people you meet along the way, whether it's through clubs or just striking up a conversation. These friendships have become invaluable to me, and I'll cherish them long after graduation. Plus, I'll miss those evenings spent hanging out with friends, going on tea breaks, and the mischief we got up to during college life  ‚Äì those memories will always bring a smile to my face.",
	"question_2": "One cool idea for implementing change in college would be to create more opportunities for interaction and collaboration among Batchmates. This could involve organizing regular group activities or workshops aimed at building personality traits like public speaking skills, teamwork, and leadership. Additionally, enhancing the greenery on campus by adding more beautiful plants and creating tranquil spaces could promote mental well-being and create a peaceful environment for students to thrive in.",
